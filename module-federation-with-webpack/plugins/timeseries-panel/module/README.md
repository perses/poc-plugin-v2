# Timeseries Panel Module

Originally started from https://github.com/OmerHerera/module-federation-post/tree/main/remote-react-module, which seems to be derivated from this [example](https://github.com/module-federation/module-federation-examples/tree/master/advanced-api/dynamic-remotes-runtime-environment-variables) from the [module-federation/module-federation-examples](https://github.com/module-federation/module-federation-examples) (lot of interesting examples there).

## Set Up and run module as a standalone process

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Then navigate to: [http://localhost:8082/](http://localhost:8082/)
